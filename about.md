## We're Ritter Insurance Marketing's software development department

[Ritter Insurance Marketing](https://ritterim.com) (RIM) is a Field Marketing Organization (FMO) in the Senior Life and Health Insurance markets. That means we promote and distribute insurance carriers’ products to licensed agents.

RIMdev (catchy, huh?!) develops the tools to facilitate the success of these agents, helping them succeed and better support their clients.

We continue to develop a suite of RIM software products, [Medicare Quote Engine](https://medicarequoteengine.com/), [eBroker Software](https:??ebrokersoftware.com)'s embeddable quote engine featuring direct enrollment through [Healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov), and [medicareful.com](https://medicareful.com), for over 65 Medicare Health Insurance quotes, while contributing to support Open-Source Software initiatives and speaking.
