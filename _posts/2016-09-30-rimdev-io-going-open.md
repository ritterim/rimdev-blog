Our team believes in being open and transparent, and while we write consistently with some amazing content, we are equally as proud of what we've done with the Jekyll platform. Based on our philosophy of a team being open, transparent, and known as contributors we have decided to make our site a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/ritterim/ritterim.github.io). 

> What does this mean for our average reader?

Well, not much really, other than you can now see the conversation that goes into creating a post. You can also directly help edit or update content on a post if you are inclined to do so. [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ritterim/ritterim.github.io/issues) for the win!

> Can I use some of the code and structure you guys have developed?

Heck Yes! For those looking to jump start their team blog, they can use the structure and even the theme we've developed. It works well on top of the existing GitHub infrastructure, and you could also reference our previous [Jekyll posts](http://rimdev.io/tags/#jekyll) if you'd like to run your blog in Windows Azure.

Finally, we believe that we, as a community, are stronger together. If you feel compelled to do so, you can submit a guest post for consideration.

**All we ask is you tell us about what you are doing and give credit where credit is due.**
