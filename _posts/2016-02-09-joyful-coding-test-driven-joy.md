Software developers want to ship products that *work*. No matter how you accomplish it, you need to ensure you're shipping stuff that *works* without unexpected errors. There are two major ways to accomplish this:

1. Automated tests
2. Manually interacting with an application

## The joy of automated tests

If you're on the trapeze, automated tests are your safety net. You can fly high and try out some *new trick* -- knowing that if you miss there's a safety net. It's always there, it's reliable, and sometimes it's even fun to slam into it!

Writing tests while coding can lead to an experience of relaxation and joy. There's no *wild* clicking over and over as you iterate. Exchange this for quick usage of `npm test` or equivalent to *see how you're doing*. Broke every test in the code base? Have the test runner itself show up in the stack trace? No worries, have a laugh -- you just slammed into the safety net!

## More than fast feedback

A fast feedback cycle is important to working efficiently. If validating every keystroke requires twenty minutes, you'll get very little done.

But, I think automated tests go beyond simply decreasing the feedback cycle duration and other *business-y reasons*. It's the joy that comes with eliminating all of the *extra steps*. The joy of not clicking tediously around a web app. Who doesn't want to relax, have a great time, and make something awesome?

The alternative to writing automated tests to guide my efforts in some cases means *tedicous, laborious work*.

## In closing

Having a joyful coding experience can boil down to having a reliable safety net. Try new ideas and immediately find out if they work or not. Not sure how the language works in a particular case? Change it, run the tests. Relax as the answer is delightfully presented to you.

Write tests, not just for regression protection and because *you should* -- but for the joy and comfort of writing high-quality code methodically and joyfully.
