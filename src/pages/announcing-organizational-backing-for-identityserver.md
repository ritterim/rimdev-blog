At Ritter Insurance Marketing we value our peers and other organizations in the overall software community.

We believe in the power of community and open source. Why spend effort on a problem that an individual or a team has already solved for the *unknown-unknowns* you aren't even aware of? We also don't believe in reinventing the wheel *(unless, of course, we can construct a much better wheel...)*. As developers we are here for each other -- sharing thoughts, ideas, and code where applicable.

While many freely invest their time (which is perhaps open source's most valuable resource) sometimes a project can also benefit from financial support, especially when it hits *bigtime* status. Everyone loves open source libraries, but who is ultimately willing to fund their development in both time and currency? Who will manage the issues? Review pull requests? Projects driven and backed by a large corporation to solve their own problems have their own built-in organizational support. But, some projects that developers rely upon don't have any sort of corporate backing.

In 2018 we are raising the bar from solely contributing our time to also contributing with our financial resources. **We are excited to announce that we will be financially supporting [IdentityServer][IdentityServer]**, which we rely upon for authenticating both internal and external users for our systems.

## Summary

Being a consumer isn't a bad thing, but contributing back to the community strengthens all of us. As an organization we have a number of open source projects. Now, we're proud to financially back a project we rely upon as an organization: [IdentityServer][IdentityServer].
