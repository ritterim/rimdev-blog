On July 18th, 2016 [the ASP.NET Monsters](https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters) announced [a Summer Of Config](http://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/07/summerofconfig/) contest.

> The Summer of Config is all about creating the wackiest, most insane configuration provider that you can dream up. We want you jammin’ on the ASP.NET Core code, bringing us your questions, experimenting with the code and seeing your creativity. BRING IT ON!

**So we did just that!** We had three entries:

1. [GPS Configuration provider](https://www.billboga.com/posts/creating-a-gps-configuration-provider-for-aspnet-core-10)
2. [Voice Recognition provider](http://rimdev.io/speech-recognition-configuration-provider-for-asp.net-core/)
3. [Twitter provider](https://www.billboga.com/posts/creating-a-twitter-configuration-provider-for-aspnet-core-10)

On September 1st, 2016 [Bill Boga](http://billboga.com) and [Khalid Abuhakmeh (me)](http://khalidabuhakmeh.com) won 1st and 2nd place respectively. Definitely a fun competition and congratulations to Bill Boga for blowing some minds and taking the victory (even if it was from me :P).
