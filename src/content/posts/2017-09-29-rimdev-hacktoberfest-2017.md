[Hacktoberfest 2017][hacktoberfest] is upon us and now is a great opportunity to contribute to open source and the community as a whole. At RIMdev we've made it easy to [get into open source][oss]:

- We work in GitHub
- We use open source heavily in our projects
- Our blog is open source
- We have our own OSS projects

## The Rules

What do you need to know?

> Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.
Rules
> To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contains commits you made yourself. Pull requests reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt.
